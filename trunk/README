Required software:

1.  Fortran compiler (gfortran/Intel)
2.  CC compiler (gcc is fine)
3.  netCDF3/4 installation with fortran (3 vs 4 depends on which version used to write foray files)


BUILD instructions
------------------

1.  Edit the Makefile to put in your fortran and C compilers.  Two examples are provided.

2.  Setup proper links to the netCDF libs.  The fortran needs the include directory to use the netcdf module interface.

3.  Compile by typing "make"
    One executable is built:  "x.oban

================================================================================

changes for version 2.0 of OPAWS (5 March 2011) - LJW
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed bugs in FORAY processing when no good data is present
* Tried to elimiate any memory leaks in code
* Removed ncgen calls from code - all netcdf files written now with pure fortran

changes for version 2.0 of OPAWS (10 December 2010 - 8 February 2011) - DCD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Merged NSSL_Oban2D (version 2.3) and OPAWS (version 1.6.1)
   - oban.f90:  oban2f.f90 and oban2s.f90 have been combined (new executable "x.oban")
                - *** NEW oban.input PARAMETER REQUIRED:  radar_data_format
                - minrange condition for thresholding added to readforay, as in readsweep
                - either min or max thresholding added to readforay, as in readsweep
                - added sweep information (includes Nyquist velocity) to input and output
                - modifed calculation of "time" array so that it is zero if the translation velocity is nonzero
   - DART.f:  using newer OPAWS version
              added qc value to output
   - fileio.f:  renamed from fileio2.f (NSSL_Oban2D)
                removed long section of commented-out code at the end
                renamed WRITENETCDF2 to WRITENETCDF
                changed formatted integer output to "I0" in WRITENETCDF
                added height to output in WRITENETCDF
                renamed DARTout2 to DART_radar_out, and incorporated updates from OPAWS 1.6.1
                added clear-air reflectivity observation type to DART_radar_out
                renamed WRITEV5D2 to WRITEV5D
                changed bottomhgt from 0.0 to zmin in WRITEV5D
                added subroutine write_beam_info
                added which_vert value to parameter list in calls to write_DART_ob
                added qc value to output
                modified WRITENETCDF so that missing_value is written once, rather than twice, for each field
   - oban.f90, fileio.f:  changed naming convention for output obs_seq file
   - derived_types.f90:  added SWEEP_INFORMATION derived type
                         added Nyquist_Velocity to FORAY_DATA
   - moved to old_code subdirectory:  clutter_unfold.f
   - renamed dow.inc to opaws.inc
   - removed ncgen_module, with ncgen_command, from derived_types.f90 and moved ncgen_command to oban.f90
                - *** NEW oban.input PARAMETER REQUIRED:  ncgen_command
*  Changed oban input from sequential to namelist format (*** oban.nml replaces oban.input ***)
*  Corrected bugs and unified procedure for determining radar location.  Now, if rlat, rlon, and ralt are specified
   in oban.nml, then these values are used.  Otherwise, these parameters are determined from the radar data themselves.
*  Corrected mismatch between mpass2d_oban parameter lists in oban.f90 and mpass_oban2d.f90.
*  Initialized namelist parameters with default values in oban_namelist.f90.
*  Added a subroutine verify_namelists that checks for the minimum information necessary for an objective analysis.
*  Changed the names of some input parameters:  umass_flag to umass_data, extrapolate_flag to allow_extrapolation.
*  Changed date and time corrections so that all specified parameters (year_cor, day_cor, sec_cor) are offsets.


changes for version 2.3 of NSSL_Oban2D (22 November 2010) - LJW
---------------------------------------------------------------

*  Incorporated fixes by Robin Tanamachi and Dan Dawson.
   These included dealing with sweep files that have 0 for one of the fields
         on successive scans (e.g., DDC from Greensburg, 2007)
   Added more sophsticated pre-oban and post-oban filters

*  Added in ability in variable specification to output std. deviation from 
   input oban deck (useful for DART)

*  IMPORTANT: pre-v2.3 input files are NOT COMPATABLE!!!!!
   Two changes:
   Line 10+: Added the std. deviation value to read variable line at end
  ~Line 22+: Added sec_offset value after day correction to be able to correct
             time errors in sweeps (like the KOUN 8 May data set, off by 150 s)

*  Added example Python script (pyOban.8may03_6min_2km.py) to process long list of 
   input files which can be crafted to do more specific things with a generic input deck. 

   type:  pyOban.8may03_6min_2km.py --help 

   to see options.

================================================================================

changes for version 2.2 of NSSL_Oban2D (5 March 2010) - LJW
-----------------------------------------------------------
* Cleaned up the code, added some of the threhold filtering options.  Oban input files are NOT COMPATIABLE with other
  versions, please look at the documentation from your old oban files for comparison.  They are close, but not the same.

* Added benchmark directory called "test_oban".  See README_TEST file in that directory to test your build.
  You can check to see if your build of the code works on your machine against my results.

* Code was compiled and tested with Intel Fortran v11.1 running on MacPro and MacBook Pro using Snow Leopard 10.6.3

* Code was compiled and tested with GNU gfortran/gcc v4.3 running on MacPro and MacBook Pro using Snow Leopard 10.6.3

changes for version 2.1  of NSSL_Oban2D(3 March 2010) - LJW
-----------------------------------------------------------

oban2s:  "SWEEP" reader version of the software
oban2f:  "FORAY" reader version of the software

changes for version 2.0  of NSSL_Oban2D(5 Feb 2010) - LJW
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* new version that can only do 2D analysis on PPI surface.  Multipass Cressman and Barnes are
possible, though MP Cressman is a kludge and not recommended.  Back interpolation to observation
point is via bi-linear interpolation.

* IMPORTANT:  input file is NOT backward compatible - please use input file in this directory
              Mostly, things have been removed that are not necessary or supported.

* IMPORTANT:  code still uses netCDF utility NCGEN to construct the netCDF file.  Please EDIT the top of the
              file "derived_types.f90" to reflect the location of your ncgen command.

* Code was rewritten to support new data structures for both radar observations and analysis grids.

* Three output files are currently generated automatically:  'prefix'.v5d, 'prefix'.out (DART file), 'prefix'.nc

* netCDF files can be plotted using the PlotOban.py software.

* Currently, only "solo-dorade" sweep files can be inputted, however, new data structure greatly faciliates
  the implementation of other formats.  WDSS-II and Foray netcdf formats input files will be implemented soon.

* Re-implementation of 3D analysis schemes are planned, and would require small changes.

* Some changes in the Makefile

* Most of the new routines I have written, if they existed in the original versions, now are called "2", such as fileio2, etc.

  Lou Wicker, 5 Febuary 2010.


changes for version 1.6.1 of OPAWS (2-10 March 2010, 1 September 2010, 10 November 2010)
--------------------------------------------
* Modified oban so that it accepts the name of the input parameter file on the command line.
* Changed algorithm for detecting "duplicate" reflectivity sweeps for super-res 88D data in ppi_oban in util.f.

* Changed maxflds to 20 in dow.inc.
* Modified read_dorade.c so that it checks for exact parameter name match.
* Added an option IFLPORT which affects whether the "use iflport" command (needed for Intel Fortran compiler)
  is invoked in the folowing files:  oban.f, fileio.f.
* Changed order of arguments in "oban" linking in Makefile.
* Replaced instances of 'I' with 'I0' and 'F' with 'ES14.7' in formatted output in fileio.f.


changes for version 1.5.12 of OPAWS (2 October 2009, 15 January 2010, 3 February 2010)
--------------------------------------------
* Added height (km AGL) to netcdf output from oban if output_format is 2 (ppi).
* Modified read_dorade.c and read_dorade.h to allow for multiple lengths of RADD and PARM blocks.
* Modified sweepread in read_dorade.c so that it returns data of size 0 (rather than terminating)
  if a field is not found.
* Added a new subroutine read_csfd to read_dorade.c and read_dorade.h that initializes the same
  data as read_celv.
* Added offset_fac to input and to calculations in read_sh_arr in read_dorade.c.
* Added code to ppi_oban in util.f that deletes the current sweep of reflectivity data
  if the field name is 'REF' (e.g., super-res 88D data) and if the elevation angle is
  a duplicate of the previous sweep of 88D data.
* Moved code for matching azimuth angles from different scans in ground-clutter removal
  from find_clutter in find_clutter.f to ppi_oban in util.f.


changes for version 1.5.11 of OPAWS (8-26 November 2007, 25 February 2008, 2 May 2008, 23 September 2008)
--------------------------------------------
* Added new parameters min_threshold and max_threshold for each objectively
  analyzed field (oban.f, util.f, oban.input).
* Removed f1_threshold from input parameters (oban.f) and call to ppi_oban (oban.f and util.f).
* Changed thresholding based on field #1 to use values specified by min_threshold(1) and max_threshold(1)
  (ppi_oban in util.f).
* Corrected count of number of valid observations (ppi_oban in util.f).
* Modified logic for determining which reflectivity observations are clear air
  observations (fileio.f).
* Added input of a "bad obs" list to DART_sfc_obs.f (requires a new line in the input files).
* Added capability of reading data from http://data.nssl.noaa.gov in DART_sfc_obs.f.
* Added D1 and V1 to known fields for reflectivity and velocity, respectively.
* Modified ppi_oban in util.f so that if time-to-space conversion is used, the times (days and secs)
  are changed to the reference ("central") time.


changes for version 1.5.10 of OPAWS (2 August - 12 September 2007)
---------------------------------------------------
* Added -heap-arrays to OPT in Makefile for Intel 10.0 compiler on Mac.
* Added code to DART_radar_out in fileio.f that alternates the index ordering
  from one sweep to the next when thinning clear air reflectivity obs.
* Added capability of reading StickNet data to DART_sfc_obs.f.


changes for version 1.5.9 of OPAWS (27 March - 25 July 2007)
---------------------------------------------------
* Created a new DART observation type in DART.f:  RADAR_CLEARAIR_REFLECTIVITY.
* To DART_radar_out subroutine in fileio.f, added optional code that outputs a reflectivity observation
  as one of two types:  RADAR_REFLECTIVITY or RADAR_CLEARAIR_REFLECTIVITY.  The default
  is the former type.  The latter type applies when data-void filling is used and the
  objectively analyzed value is the same as the fill_value.
* Added input of new parameters in oban.f, to control how clear air reflectivity is handled.
  (Note:  oban.input files must be updated to include these new parameters.)
* Added -m64 to OPT and CFLAGS in Makefile (seems to be necessary for gcc to work together with Intel
  Fortran compiler 10.0).
* Removed -Wl,-stack_size from OPT in Makefile (also seems to be necessary to build programs with
  Intel compiler 10.0).
* Corrected function timediff in util.f, so that the deltat calculation does not begin with an
  unitialized value.


changes for version 1.5.8 of OPAWS (13 March 2007)
--------------------------------------------
* Removed the program "snakeplot.f" from the code distribution.
* Added write_beam_info subroutine to fileio.f.
* Added code to oban to collect beam information and write beam_info.nc.
* Created new script snakeplot.ncl to plot beam information.


changes for version 1.5.7 of OPAWS (1-10 March 2007)
--------------------------------------------
* Modified retrievepb.f and Makefile to compile retrievepb for NCL output
  rather than NCAR Graphics.
* Changed name of subroutine sdin_netcdf to readnetcdf in fileio.f.
* Added section in retrievepb.f that sets F, G, and H to zero where data
  are created by hole filling.
* Added option of outputting temperature or potential temperature in DART_sfc_obs.f.
* Added new obs_kind (THETA_2m) and obs_name (METAR_POT_TEMP_2_METER) to DART.f.
* Added flag t_or_td passed to DART_sfc_out in fileio.f.


changes for version 1.5.6 of OPAWS (13-14 February 2007)
--------------------------------------------
* Modified DART_sfc_obs.f to handle any order of fields in GEMPAK file.
* Corrected error in observation count in DART_sfc_obs.f.


changes for version 1.5.5 of OPAWS (16 December 2006-19 January 2007)
------------------------------------------------------------
* Added a new input data format -- text file produced by GEMPAK -- to DART_sfc_obs.
* Added vertical coordinate type as input to DART_sfc_obs.
* Added build options for Mac OSX 10.4.8 (Intel) to Makefile.
* Commented out zdr and kdp output in write_DART_header.
* Replaced int(KN+0.5) and int(KN-0.5) with nint(KN) in ppi_oban in util.f


changes for version 1.5.4 of OPAWS (14 September 2006)
---------------------------------------------
* Increased number of input flags to oban for removing ground clutter:
  (1) reflectivity threshold, (2) echo top, (3) spin change, (4) vertical gradient.
* Moved vertical gradient test outside spin change test in find_clutter.f
  (remove_clutter subroutine).
* Cleaned up vertical gradient test so that it is only applied when both upper
  and lower reflectivity values are valid.
* Changed vertical gradient test so that removal occurs only when vertical
  reflectivity gradient is negative.


changes for version 1.5.3 of OPAWS (19 June 2006)
--------------------------------------------
* Added Macintosh build option to Makefile.
* Added "sequence" statement to derived type definitions in structures.inc,
  so that xlf compiler on Mac doesn't complain.
* Added code to DART_sfc_obs.f to reject bad Mesonet data.


changes for version 1.5.2 of OPAWS (14 June 2006)
--------------------------------------------
* Added code from Mike Coniglio for reading Oklahoma Mesonet
  data in DART_sfc_obs.
* Expanded sfc_sites.txt file to include Mesonet stations.


changes for version 1.5.1 of OPAWS (8 June 2006)
--------------------------------------------
* Added find_clutter.o to OBJS2 in Makefile.
* Modified xderiv, yderiv, and zderiv in util.f to catch case
  when number of gridpoints = 1.


changes for version 1.5 of OPAWS (2 March-3 June 2006)
--------------------------------------------
* Added compiler option -DLONG32 for compiling software that uses subroutines
  in read_dorade.c to read sweep files.  This option, which is needed for
  reading sweep files on a 64-bit system that were created on a 32-bit system,
  forces the "long" (64-bit integer on 64-bit systems, 32-bit integer on 32-bit
  systems) C data type to be read as "int" (32-bit integer) C data type instead.
  Creating the -DLONG32 option required changes to the following source code:
  Makefile, read_dorade.h, read_dorade.c.
* Added Mike Conglio's subroutine for ground-clutter removal:
  - added Mike's "find_clutter.f" code to Makefile
  - added Mike's code for calling find_clutter to ppi_oban in util.f
  - added "remove_clutter" flag to oban.f and call to ppi_oban
  This change requires an extra line in "oban.input" files.
* Added "DART.f" module (from PyENCOMMAS) to code distribution and removed
  redundant code in "fileio.f".
* Changed DART output ("write_DART_ob" subroutine in "fileio.f") so that
  longitudes are always positive.
* Changed name of DARTout to DART_radar_out in "fileio.f".
* Added new subroutine DART_sfc_out to "fileio.f".
* Created new program DART_sfc_obs, for creating DART format surface ob. files.
* Added option for reading all sweep files with a given path name in "oban"
  (activated with nswp=-1).


changes for version 1.4 of OPAWS (11 February 2006)
------------------------------------------
* Added units to netcdf output for 3D fields.
* Added functonality to scalar_vec.ncl.


changes for version 1.3.1 of OPAWS (10 February 2006)
--------------------------------------------
* In "vorticity" subroutine of util.f, changed derivative computations
  to allow uncentered finite differences if centered finite differences
  aren't possible.
* Added a new program "az_point_target" for retrieving azimuth-angle-offsets
  from point-target coordinates relative to two radars.
* Added functionality to scalar_vec.ncl.


changes for version 1.3 of OPAWS (30 January 2006)
-----------------------------------------
Made several changes to "oban" program:
* added capability of replacing missing-data values at individual gates
  with a user-specified value.  (The "oban.input" format was modified slightly.)
* added more flexibility for correcting times.  (The "oban.input" format was
  modified slightly.)
* changed "timediff" computation to be based on each beam's julian day
  rather than the volume's year, month, and day
* added differential reflectivity and specific differential phase shift
  to DART output


changes for version 1.2 of OPAWS (18 December 2005)
------------------------------------------
* Updated DARTout and write_DART_ob subroutines in fileio.f for new DART observation file format

* Added option of local velocity unfolding (Miller et al 1986) to oban program.  This new option
  requires a new field in any input parameter file used to run oban.  The new field (unfold_flag)
  appears on each line where a field to be interpolated is specified.  Note that local unfolding
  is performed only if the output data are PPI rather than Cartesian.

* Added Nyquist_vel as a field in DART format observation files produced by oban.


changes for version 1.1 of OPAWS (9 October 2005)
-------------------------------------------------
* corrected error with reading of zmin in sdin_netcdf subroutine of fileio.f


Recent changes to code (as of 4 August 2005) for version 1.0 of OPAWS
---------------------------------------------------------------------
* netcdf output from oban, netcdf input to dualdop, and netcdf output from dualdop have been
  added; the format includes all variables/fields in the netcdf format produced by CEDRIC, plus
  a few more variables

* an example script scalar_vec.ncl is provided for plotting netcdf files

* a new program "snakeplot" has been created; previously, this functionality was in "oban";
  snakeplot reads files in the "oban.input" format; snakeplot requires NCAR Graphics

* the Makefile has been updated, since oban and dualdop no longer require NCAR Graphics

* oban and azdd no longer input azcor1 and azcor2 separately for each sweep; now, these factors
  are assumed to be the same for all sweeps; changes to earlier versions of "oban.input" files
  will be needed as a result of these changes

* oban and dualdop now input fewer parameters; changes to earlier versions of "oban.input"
  and "dualdop.input" files will be needed as a result of these changes

* writev5d (called from oban and dualdop) is now configured to automatically write out all/most
  known fields

* an error in zderivc (in util.f) has been corrected

* structures.h has been renamed to structures.inc

* more fields (specifically, tilting and stretching) have been added to the output from dualdop

* sdout (in fileio.f), which outputs text data from oban, has been changed to output all significant
  digits for floating point numbers
