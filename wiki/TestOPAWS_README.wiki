# You can test both FORAY and SWEEP file data to check and make sure the 
# code is running correctly  These files were created on Mac OS X 10.6
# with the Intel Fortran compiler and netCDF4.
#
# The radar data is the first few sweeps of interest from the KCYS WSR-88D radar from the
# 5 June 2009 Goshem County V2 case.
#
# Procedure:
#
# 0.  Download the test_opaws.tar from the Downloads directory at http://code.google.com/p/opaws/
# 1.  Download and compile the opaws code.
# 2.  Untar the test_opaws.tar and copy the x.oban executable into the test_opaws directory
# 3.  To test either type of input file:
#
#      x.oban oban.nml.foray
#      x.oban oban.nml.sweep
#
#      You now should have generated the following files: kcys_foray.nc, kcys_foray.v5d, obs_seq_kcys_foray.out (DART obs_seq file)
#      You now should have generated the following files: kcys_sweep.nc, kcys_sweep.v5d, obs_seq_kcys_sweep.out (DART obs_seq file)
#
# 4.  You can quickly visualize the files using vis5D generated by the oban.  You 
# can compare your files to the kcys_vis5d_****.v5d files in the directory.
#
# 5.  You can look at your oban data in more detail using the outputted netcdf files.  I have written a python script that
#       plots the netCDF data files and creates a HTML file to browse the data in a web browser.
#
#        You need either a) Enthought Python Distribution (free for academics at http://enthought.com/) or
#                        b) a python distribution (> 2.4) with matplotlib and netCDF4 installed
#                           matplotlib can be downloaded and installed from:  http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
#                           netCDF4 can be downloaded and installed from:  http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/
#
#                           BIG HINT:  download the EPD software - its far, far less painful.
#
#                        Because the PlotOban.py script imports some other codes, its best simply to copy
#                        the PythonScripts to the local test directory from the opaws directory.
#
#                        i)  copy your PythonScripts directory from the opaws directory.
#                       ii)  type:  ./PythonScripts/PlotOban.py -f kcys_sweep.nc -d sweep_test
#                              or the correspondng file for foray analyses
#
#                     iii)   open the sweep_test.html file to see the generated output.
#                      iv)   open the sweep_output.html to see the files I generated and compare.
#
#                      if you type:  PlotOban.py -h (or --help) you will see a list of command line options.
#                      for large data sets, this is a nice way to look at 100's of sweep files quickly.
#
#                      It should possibly work on 3D volumes that are analyzed to a cartesian grid for DD analysis,
#                      but the elevation will be the average elevation from the data in the horizontal plane.
