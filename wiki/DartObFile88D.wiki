#summary steps for creating a DART-format observation file from WSR-88D data

A common task in storm-scale data assimilation is to produce [http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART_Observations.php#obs_seq_overview Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) format] observation files for archived WSR-88D data.  Here is a summary of one way to accomplish this task.
