#summary formats of input radar data and output analysis data

= Input Radar Data =

Radar data that are input to OPAWS can be in one of the following two formats:  

  * Dorade sweep files
  * Foray NetCDF (Foray-1 version).

*Dorade sweep files*

Developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
DORADE radar-data format: http://www.ral.ucar.edu/projects/titan/docs/radial_formats/DoradeDoc.pdf

  * Used by the NCAR SOLO editing program
  * Radar format for VORTEX, VORTEX2 radar data

*Foray NetCDF*

developed by NCAR EOL:  see Foray:  http://www.eol.ucar.edu/Members/dennisf/foray


= Output Analysis Data =

It outputs gridded data in either two-dimensions (on the PPI conical surface) or three-dimensions in netcdf, Vis5d, and DART (Data Assimilation Research Testbed) formats.
