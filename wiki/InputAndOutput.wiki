#summary Formats of input radar data and output analysis data are described here.

= Input Radar Data =

Radar data that are input to OPAWS can be in one of the following formats.

*Dorade sweep files*

At present, OPAWS can process NCAR Dorade (sweep) and NCAR EOL Foray (netcdf) radar data.

*Foray NetCDF*


DORADE radar-data format:  http://www.ral.ucar.edu/projects/titan/docs/radial_formats/DoradeDoc.pdf

Foray:  http://www.eol.ucar.edu/Members/dennisf/foray2


= Output Analysis Data =

It outputs gridded data in either two-dimensions (on the PPI conical surface) or three-dimensions in netcdf, Vis5d, and DART (Data Assimilation Research Testbed) formats.
